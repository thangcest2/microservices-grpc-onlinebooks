# About: microservices-grpc-onlinebooks in python3
I need to see grpc in more real-life services, real different with JSON, how the client-server works. Code here was from realpython.com. But I packed them all and will give a video/my real account for saving your time.

# What we will play with:
1. Local client-server with grpc
2. Local client-server with grpc - but with docker/docker-compose/poetry
3. Host images to our own docker hub
4. Deploy to docker desktop
5. Deploy to a real gcp account

# Latest status of this project: 
Paused at writing kubernetes.yml to push my docker images to my docker hub account first.
